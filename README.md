# ü§ñ AI Form Filler - Chrome Extension

Tired of manually filling out web forms? **AI Form Filler** is a Chrome extension that leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to intelligently complete forms for you based on text, voice, or even image input!

_(Pro-tip: Replace the placeholder above with an actual screenshot or GIF of your extension in action!)_

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Modal Input:**
    -   üìù **Text:** Type your instructions (e.g., "Fill login with user test, pass 123").
    -   üéôÔ∏è **Voice:** Speak your form-filling commands directly.
    -   üñºÔ∏è **Image:** Upload an image (like a picture of a filled paper form or a data table), and let the AI extract and fill.
-   **Smart Form Selection:**
    -   üéØ **Click-to-Select:** Don't want the AI to guess? Click the "Select Form on Page" button and then click _on or near_ the form you want to target.
    -   üëÄ **Visual Feedback:** Active form selection mode highlights all detectable forms, and your chosen form gets a special highlight.
-   **AI-Powered Filling:**
    -   üß† Uses Google's Gemini AI (specifically `gemini-2.5-flash` model via API) for understanding context and extracting data.
    -   üîç Intelligently matches extracted/provided data to the correct form fields.
-   **Contextual Understanding:** Provides the AI with the structure of all forms on the page and your specific input to make informed decisions.
-   **User-Friendly Popup:** Clean interface to manage inputs, select forms, and view AI responses.

## üöÄ How It Works (The Gist)

1.  **Input:** You provide information via text, voice recording, an uploaded image, or by selecting a specific form on the page.
2.  **Extraction:** The extension identifies all HTML `<form>` elements on the active webpage and notes their structure.
3.  **AI Magic:** Your input and the forms' structures are sent to the Gemini AI API.
4.  **Structured Response:** Gemini analyzes everything and returns a JSON object specifying which form to target (or confirms your selection) and which fields to fill with what values.
5.  **Auto-Fill:** The extension then takes this JSON and populates the identified form fields on the webpage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

As this is a local development version:

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    -   Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-form-filler.git`
    -   Or, download the ZIP and extract it.
2.  **Enable Developer Mode in Chrome:**
    -   Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    -   Toggle on "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
3.  **Load the Extension:**
    -   Click the "Load unpacked" button.
    -   Select the directory where you cloned or extracted the project files.
4.  **Get Your Gemini API Key:**
    -   You'll need an API key for Google's Generative AI (Gemini). You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
5.  **Configure API Key:**
    -   Open the `background.js` file in the extension's directory.
    -   Find the line: `const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";` (or similar, it might have a placeholder key already).
    -   Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual, valid Gemini API key.
    -   **üö® IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:** Do **NOT** commit your actual API key to a public GitHub repository. This line is for local development. For a production extension, you'd use a more secure method like `chrome.storage` or a backend proxy.
6.  **Ready to Go!** The AI Form Filler icon should appear in your Chrome toolbar.

## üí° Usage

1.  Navigate to a webpage with a form you want to fill.
2.  Click the **AI Form Filler extension icon** in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup.
3.  **(Optional but Recommended for Precision):**
    -   Click the "Select Form on Page" button. The popup will indicate you're in selection mode.
    -   Switch to the webpage and click on (or near) the specific form you want the AI to focus on. All detectable forms will be lightly highlighted, and your mouse-over target will get a more prominent highlight.
    -   The selected form's ID will appear in the popup.
4.  **Provide Your Input:**
    -   **Text:** Type your instructions in the "Your Request" textarea.
    -   **Voice:** Click "Start Recording," speak your instructions, then "Stop Recording." An audio player will appear.
    -   **Image:** Click "Upload Image," select an image file. A preview will appear.
5.  Click the **"Process with AI"** button.
6.  The extension will show the AI's JSON response and attempt to fill the form on the page. You'll also see a list of all forms it found for context.

## üîß Configuration

The primary configuration needed is your **Gemini API Key**, as described in the Setup section (in `background.js`).

## üå± Future Ideas & Potential Improvements

This project has a lot of room to grow! Some ideas include:

-   **Field-Level Preview & Confirmation:** Visually highlight fields _before_ filling, allowing user confirmation.
-   **"Undo" Last Fill:** A crucial safety net.
-   **Secure API Key Storage:** Moving away from hardcoding for real-world use.
-   **Saved Input Templates:** Quickly fill forms with pre-saved common data (e.g., login, address).
-   **Enhanced Error Handling & Feedback:** More descriptive messages.
-   **Support for iFrames & Shadow DOMs.**
-   **Context Menu Integration.**
